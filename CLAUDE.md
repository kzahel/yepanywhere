# Claude Anywhere

## Required Reading

This is a new project. Before starting any task, read all files in `docs/project/` to understand the project vision and architecture:

- `docs/project/claude-anywhere-vision.md` - Core vision and goals
- `docs/project/project-vision.md` - Project overview
- `docs/project/security-setup.md` - Security configuration

This ensures all agents have a shared understanding of what we're building.
